# Komak-React

Komak is a medical application designed for the Pashtun people, as resources for Pashtuns are scarce in Minnesota and Pashtuns have to rely on a family member being available to interpret should an emergency situation arise. If a Pashtun has to go to the hospital and cannot find an interpreter, they can use Komak to fill out an intake form and communicate their symptoms and medical history to medical personell. The application is built using sound clips so that a user who cannot read will be able to use the application, and a doctor would be able to read the translated results and email the results to themselves via nodemailer.

## Built With

React.js, Next.js, PostgreSQL.
